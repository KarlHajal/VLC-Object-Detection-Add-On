 ### Description
 ***
 VLC extension that allows users to search for frames containing a certain object. 
 It currently only works on Linux.

### Installation
***
1- Install Tensorflow and its dependencies (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).
2- Assuming VLC is already installed, clone this repository and place both the lua script and the 'object_detector_data' folder in the '~/.local/share/vlc/lua/extensions/' directory.
3- The extension should be accessible from VLC at this point. The first time the script is executed, the COCO model will be downloaded, completing the installation. I would suggest running vlc from a terminal so that what is happening becomes apparent through output messages.

### Screenshots
